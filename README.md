Basics of Probability
1. Write a Python program to simulate the following scenarios:  
  a. Tossing a coin 10,000 times and calculating the experimental probability of heads and tails.  
  b. Rolling two dice and computing the probability of getting a sum of 7.  
2. Write a function to estimate the probability of getting at least one "6" in 10 rolls of a fair die.  

Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
3. A bag contains 5 red, 7 green, and 8 blue balls. A ball is drawn randomly, its color noted, and it is put back into the bag. If this process is repeated 1000 times, write a Python program to estimate:  
  a. The probability of drawing a red ball given that the previous ball was blue.  
  b. Verify Bayes' theorem with the simulation results.  

Random Variables and Discrete Probability
4. Generate a sample of size 1000 from a discrete random variable with the following distribution:  
  - P(X=1) = 0.25  
  - P(X=2) = 0.35  
  - P(X=3) = 0.4  
  Compute the empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation of the sample.  

Continuous Random Variables
5. Simulate 2000 random samples from an exponential distribution with a mean of 5. Visualize the distribution using:  
  a. A histogram.  
  b. A probability density function (PDF) overlay.  

Central Limit Theorem
6. Simulate the Central Limit Theorem by following these steps  
  a. Generate 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution.  
  b. Draw 1000 samples of size n = 30.  
  c. Calculate and visualize the distribution of sample means.
