Employee Management System (EMS):
Objective - Create a simplified Employee Management System (EMS). This project will cover control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts to manage employee data.
Steps Implemented:
Step 1 - Plan the Data Storage
Used a dictionary to store employee data where the keys is the emp_id (Employee ID) and the value is another dictionary containing furthur details.
Step 2 - Define the Menu System
Created a menu that displays the following options: Add Employee, View All Employees, Search for Employee, Exit
Step 3 - Add Employee Functionality
Step 4 - View All Employees
Step 5 - Search for an Employee by ID
Step 6 - Exit the Program

Project Code Structure
To keep the project organized, breaked it into functions:
main_menu(): Displays the main menu and calls the appropriate function based on user input.
add_employee(): Adds a new employee to the dictionary.
view_employees(): Displays all employee details.
search_employee(): Searches for an employee by ID.

Probability Module:

Basics of Probability
1. Write a Python program to simulate the following scenarios:  
  a. Tossing a coin 10,000 times and calculating the experimental probability of heads and tails.  
  b. Rolling two dice and computing the probability of getting a sum of 7.  
2. Write a function to estimate the probability of getting at least one "6" in 10 rolls of a fair die.  

Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
3. A bag contains 5 red, 7 green, and 8 blue balls. A ball is drawn randomly, its color noted, and it is put back into the bag. If this process is repeated 1000 times, write a Python program to estimate:  
  a. The probability of drawing a red ball given that the previous ball was blue.  
  b. Verify Bayes' theorem with the simulation results.  

Random Variables and Discrete Probability
4. Generate a sample of size 1000 from a discrete random variable with the following distribution:  
  - P(X=1) = 0.25  
  - P(X=2) = 0.35  
  - P(X=3) = 0.4  
  Compute the empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation of the sample.  

Continuous Random Variables
5. Simulate 2000 random samples from an exponential distribution with a mean of 5. Visualize the distribution using:  
  a. A histogram.  
  b. A probability density function (PDF) overlay.  

Central Limit Theorem
6. Simulate the Central Limit Theorem by following these steps  
  a. Generate 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution.  
  b. Draw 1000 samples of size n = 30.  
  c. Calculate and visualize the distribution of sample means.
