Employee Management System (EMS):
Objective - Create a simplified Employee Management System (EMS). This project will cover control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts to manage employee data.
Steps Implemented:
Step 1 - Plan the Data Storage
Used a dictionary to store employee data where the keys is the emp_id (Employee ID) and the value is another dictionary containing furthur details.
Step 2 - Define the Menu System
Created a menu that displays the following options: Add Employee, View All Employees, Search for Employee, Exit
Step 3 - Add Employee Functionality
Step 4 - View All Employees
Step 5 - Search for an Employee by ID
Step 6 - Exit the Program

Project Code Structure
To keep the project organized, breaked it into functions:
main_menu(): Displays the main menu and calls the appropriate function based on user input.
add_employee(): Adds a new employee to the dictionary.
view_employees(): Displays all employee details.
search_employee(): Searches for an employee by ID.

Probability Module:

Basics of Probability
1. Write a Python program to simulate the following scenarios:  
  a. Tossing a coin 10,000 times and calculating the experimental probability of heads and tails.  
  b. Rolling two dice and computing the probability of getting a sum of 7.  
2. Write a function to estimate the probability of getting at least one "6" in 10 rolls of a fair die.  

Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
3. A bag contains 5 red, 7 green, and 8 blue balls. A ball is drawn randomly, its color noted, and it is put back into the bag. If this process is repeated 1000 times, write a Python program to estimate:  
  a. The probability of drawing a red ball given that the previous ball was blue.  
  b. Verify Bayes' theorem with the simulation results.  

Random Variables and Discrete Probability
4. Generate a sample of size 1000 from a discrete random variable with the following distribution:  
  - P(X=1) = 0.25  
  - P(X=2) = 0.35  
  - P(X=3) = 0.4  
  Compute the empirical mean, variance, and standard deviation of the sample.  

Continuous Random Variables
5. Simulate 2000 random samples from an exponential distribution with a mean of 5. Visualize the distribution using:  
  a. A histogram.  
  b. A probability density function (PDF) overlay.  

Central Limit Theorem
6. Simulate the Central Limit Theorem by following these steps  
  a. Generate 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution.  
  b. Draw 1000 samples of size n = 30.  
  c. Calculate and visualize the distribution of sample means.  

Module 7 - Advanced Python Tools
Assignment 1 - Working with NumPy
Objective Understand the basics of NumPy, array creation, and manipulation.
Instructions:
Step 1 Install NumPy using
pip install numpy
Step 2 Create a new Python script numpy_assignment.ipynb. Import NumPy and follow these steps:  
1. Create a 1D NumPy array with integers from 1 to 20. Perform the following operations:  
  a. Calculate the sum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the elements in the array.  
  b. Find the indices of elements greater than 10 in the array.  
2. Create a 2D NumPy array of shape 4 X 4 with numbers ranging from 1 to 16.  
  a. Print the array.  
  b. Find the transpose of the array.  
  c. Calculate the row-wise and column-wise sums of the array.  
3. Create two 3 X 3 arrays filled with random integers between 1 and 20.  
  a. Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  
  b. Compute the dot product of the two arrays.  
4. Reshape a 1D array of size 12 into a 3 X 4 2D array and slice the first two rows and last two columns.  

Assignment 2 - Working with Pandas
Objective Learn to create and manipulate dataframes for data analysis.  
Instructions
Step 1 Install Pandas using:
pip install pandas

Step 2 Create a new Python script pandas_assignment.ipynb. Import Pandas and follow these steps:  
1. Create a DataFrame with the following data:  
  data = {
      'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'],
      'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32, 29],
      'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'Marketing', 'HR'],
      'Salary': [45000, 54000, 50000, 62000, 47000]
  }
  a. Print the first five rows of the DataFrame.  
  b. Get the summary statistics of the 'Age' and 'Salary' columns.  
  c. Calculate the average salary of employees in the 'HR' department.  
2. Add a new column, 'Bonus', which is 10% of the salary.  
3. Filter the DataFrame to show employees aged between 25 and 30.  
4. Group the data by 'Department' and calculate the average salary for each department.  
5. Sort the DataFrame by 'Salary' in ascending order and save the result to a new CSV file.  

Assignment 3 - Working with Matplotlib
Objective: Practice data visualization techniques for better data representation.  
Instructions:
Step 1 Install Matplotlib using:
pip install matplotlib

Step 2 Create a new Python script matplotlib_assignment.ipynb. Import Matplotlib and follow these steps:  
1. Create a simple line plot for the following data:
  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  y = [10, 15, 25, 30, 50]
  a. Plot the data.  
  b. Customize the plot by adding a title, axis labels, and a grid.

3. Create a bar graph to represent the marks scored by students in a subject:  
  students = ['John', 'Jane', 'Alice', 'Bob']
  marks = [75, 85, 60, 90]
  a. Plot the data as a bar graph.  
  b. Customize the colors and add a title.  
  
4. Create a pie chart to represent the percentage distribution of a companyâ€™s revenue from different regions:  
  regions = ['North America', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'Others']
  revenue = [45, 25, 20, 10]
  a. Create a pie chart with the region names as labels.  
  b. Highlight the region with the highest revenue.  

5. Generate a histogram to show the frequency distribution of randomly generated integers between 1 and 100 (sample size = 1000).
